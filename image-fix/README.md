# AI Art Workflow - Image Fix

## 📚 Overview

[Context](../README.md)

This script takes any images in `input/*` and resizes them to 1920x1080 (adding a blur effect for anything outside that aspect ratio) to `output/*`.

## 🏃‍♀️ How to Run

Copy/paste images to `input/*` and they will show up in `output/*`.

```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install
pipenv run start
```
