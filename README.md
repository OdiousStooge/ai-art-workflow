## üìÇ Important Files

Roughly in order of how you might use them. Instructions on how to use these are in associated `README`s.

- `leonardo/`: Scripts and readmes for interfacing with ChatGPT to help generate prompts in a DB migration format and then bulk post prompts to [Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai/)
- `image-fix/`: Scripts for resizing (and blurring if smaller than HD) images in bulk
- `vid-fix/`: Scripts for resizing videos (and blurring as needed) in bulk similar to `image-fix`
- `yt-audio/`: Scripts for downloading audio `.mp3` from YouTube (‚ö†Ô∏è be sure to check licenses for a given video before doing this!)
- `convert-sqlite/`: Scripts to convert your `leonardo/prompts.db` to CSV if you want to share prompts
- `editing/`: Just a workspace to store any files for editing, I put my [ShotCut](https://shotcut.org/) and [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) stuff here and keep it `gitignored`.
