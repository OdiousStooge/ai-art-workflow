great, now before we generate prompts i want you to help me craft a theme prompt that I can concatenate onto the end of each prompt I will ask you for, this will give the images a common theme as I intend to create a lot of them.

I am currently working with the concept of

in the style of [⚠️rest of theme here⚠️]

can you help me improve this prompt knowing what you know now about good leonardo ai prompts? limit it to around 200 characters (loose guidance it can go under or exceed as needed)

i want to capture the style of [⚠️add import details here⚠️]
