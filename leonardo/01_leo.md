Example Prompt
Certainly! For the theme 'futuristic city', I will create four distinct artistic image prompts, each focusing on different artistic elements and styles.
Cyberpunk Style Futuristic City:
"prompt": "A vibrant, neon-lit futuristic city at night, showcasing tall skyscrapers with holographic billboards. Cyberpunk style with influences from 'Blade Runner'. The view is from a high vantage point, looking down at bustling streets filled with futuristic vehicles and pedestrians. The image is rich in detail, with a focus on neon lights reflecting off shiny surfaces, creating a wet, rainy atmosphere. Art style: detailed, digital painting. Lighting: high contrast with deep shadows and bright neon lights. Resolution: 4K, ultra high detail."

Utopian Future Cityscape:
"prompt": "An image of a serene, utopian futuristic city during a bright, sunny day. The city is filled with greenery, sustainable high-rise buildings, and smooth, flowing lines. Think of an eco-friendly, advanced society. The art style is realistic yet imaginative, with a focus on harmony and sustainability.

Resolution: 4K, crisp and clean."

Futuristic City in Space:
"prompt": "A breathtaking image of a futuristic city located on a distant planet or space station. The city should be surrounded by a star-filled sky and possibly other celestial bodies. This image should blend elements of science fiction and realism, with advanced architectural structures that defy gravity. The background should feature the vastness of space and possibly a view of a nearby planet or stars. Art style: realistic with a touch of surrealism.

The cityscape should include ruined buildings, overgrown vegetation, and remnants of high-tech devices. Lighting: dim and moody, with an emphasis on shadows. Camera angle: street level, showing both the ruins and the surviving futuristic structures. Resolution: 4K, with a focus on texture and detail."

Formula for Crafting Prompts
Effective prompts should be succinct, clear, and detailed as a general guideline.

Prompts can encompass various elements such as camera angles, types, styles, and lighting.

The skill, however, is in the choice and arrangement of words. The sequence in which you place words instructs AI tools on what aspects to emphasize during image generation. It's crucial for users to understand which details to include in the prompt, as not all elements are equally significant.

In most cases, this word order proves to be effective:

Description of the Subject + Type of Image + Image Style + Camera Viewpoint + Additional Rendering Details.

For example: A captivating landscape featuring a breathtaking mountain range bathed in the warm glow of orange and pink, capturing the sun's gentle descent on the horizon, presented in landscape photography, blending realism and impressionism, with a wide-angle perspective.

Additionally, don't forget to explore the top paid and free prompt marketplaces, where you can discover exceptional prompts to assist in crafting extraordinary images.

How to Craft a Skillful Prompt?
The key to a skillful prompt lies in its prioritization. Avoid repeating elements within your prompt. For the best results, make your prompt concise, direct, and clear.

Before beginning, take a moment to reflect: What exactly do you want your image to depict?

Enter Subject
First, ensure you have a clear idea of what you want. Begin your prompt by entering the 'Subject' in the text prompt bar. Start with a basic description to set the foundation.

The subject is the focal point for the AI to concentrate on. Use a simple word accompanied by a brief description to outline your visual concept.

For instance, if you want the AI to create an image of a flower reaching for sunlight, specify 'flower' as your subject. This will guide the Leonardo bot to focus on that element.

Add Description
After identifying the subject, enrich your prompt with a detailed description. This helps the AI to better understand and refine your artwork.

Augment your prompt by specifying aspects like location, action, colors, and other relevant details. Ensure these elements are connected to your main subject.

For example, if you mention 'A black flower glowing in a garden,' you're giving specific details such as the color of the flower and its setting, enabling the AI to form a more accurate visual representation.

Add Modifiers
Modifiers specify the medium or style of your image, such as painting, illustration, 3D image, digital art, etc.

Incorporate these modifiers into your prompt, alongside the subject and description. The general structure of your prompt should look like this:

Subject + Description + Modifiers

For instance, you could say 'An illustration of a black flower glowing in the garden' or 'A tilt-shift photograph of a black flower glowing in the garden.' These modifiers help the AI understand not just what to depict, but how to stylistically represent it.

Add Textures
Textures fundamentally alter an image's appearance, imparting a unique character to each picture. The texture you select can convey specific emotions or narratives, transforming the overall impact of your image.

Experiment with these textures to witness their transformative effect:
Rough: Imparts an unrefined, organic feel, reminiscent of natural landscapes or rustic environments.
Smooth: Ideal for creating tranquil, sleek visuals, offering a sense of calm and refinement.
Feathery: Evokes the gentle, airy quality of feathers or dandelion fluff, adding a touch of delicacy.
Polished: Gives a shiny, almost marble-like finish, suitable for modern or luxurious depictions.
Dull: Creates a subdued, understated effect, akin to the gentle fade of vintage jeans or old photographs.
Gritty: Brings a rugged, unrefined edge, perfect for capturing the feel of weathered statues or aged tools.
Matte: Offers a non-glossy finish, lending a natural, subtle appearance devoid of sheen.
Scaly: Introduces a pattern of layered scales, ideal for depicting textures similar to fish or reptiles, adding a distinct and captivating pattern.
Each texture redefines your image, turning the ordinary into something visually striking

Ensure the Order of Elements
The sequence in which you present elements in your prompt is crucial. Place the most important aspects at the beginning of the prompt, particularly when using tools like Prompt Magic v3, where specificity and clarity are key.

For example, if you're aiming for a 3D perspective of your subject, structure your prompt to highlight this right away. You might say, 'A 3D model of a black flower surrounded by white flowers reaching for sunlight in the garden.'

By leading with the modifier, you guide the AI bot to focus on the primary aspect of your image, ensuring that it addresses the most important elements first as it works on your subject.

Add Creativity
Maximizing Creativity in Your Prompt for Optimal Results. The creativity of your prompt directly influences the quality of the results. Encourage imaginative yet realistic instructions to guide the AI towards achieving your envisioned outcome.

Avoid incorporating overly complex or unrealistic elements in your prompt, as this can lead to unsatisfactory results. Strive for a harmonious balance between creativity and realism in your prompt to ensure both an innovative and pleasing outcome.

Add Lighting
Incorporating Lighting in Your Prompt for Enhanced Imagery. Lighting is crucial in bringing your image to life and setting the scene. Various types of lighting can drastically alter the mood and theme of your image, so remember to specify lighting and its angle in your prompts.
Chiaroscuro: Combines light and shadow for dramatic contrast.
Bioluminescent: Offers a natural, magical glow akin to nature's own light.
Neon: Provides vibrant, electric colors that energize the scene.
Holographic: Creates a shimmering, multi-colored effect that seems to leap from another dimension.
Bloom: Amplifies original lighting, especially highlighting the top of the subject's head and shoulders.
Spotlight: Emphasizes the main subject, making it stand out against a dimmer background.
Soft Lighting: Casts a gentle, subtle glow over the subject.
Hard Lighting: Direct and intense, it outlines the subject more sharply.
Backlight: Illuminates the subject from behind, adding a touch of drama and intrigue.
Cinematic: Gives the image a Hollywood-style flair with emotional depth.
Dramatic: Features bold contrasts and intense emotional expressions, often with a suspenseful edge.
God Rays: A variant of backlighting, with light cascading from above.
Sunlight: Bathes the subject and surroundings in warm, natural light.
Studio Light: Provides balanced lighting from all angles for a well-defined image.
Glowbioluminescent Light: Creates a soft, ethereal illumination, reminiscent of softly glowing lanterns in the night.

Utilize Commas
Using Commas to Structure Your Prompt. Commas play a vital role in distinguishing different elements within your prompt. They are especially useful for breaking up longer prompts into clear, digestible segments.

For instance, you could write, 'A tilt-shift photograph of a black flower glowing in a garden, encircled by a cluster of white flowers.' Here, the comma helps to neatly separate the main subject from the surrounding details.

Magical Words
Choosing Impactful Words to Enhance Your Image. Selecting powerful, evocative words can significantly elevate your image. Aim for impactful terms that encapsulate the essence of your vision in a single word.

Consider examples like 'Ancient,' 'Whimsical,' or 'Artstation.' Such expressive words can dramatically enhance the quality of your results. Experiment with various terms to see their effect on the artistic output of your image.

Few tips to help you write better prompts
01.Be specific: Offer precise information in your prompt to direct the AI towards creating the image you envision. Rather than simply stating "a beach," you might detail it as "a sun-kissed tropical beach adorned with palm trees and shimmering turquoise waters.
02.Use sensory language: Embed sensory elements such as hues, textures, ambient sounds, and light nuances to amplify the depth of the resulting image. Doing so fosters a more vivid and engaging visual experience.
03.Experiment with perspectives: Experiment with varied angles, vantage points, or even unconventional viewpoints in your prompts to produce distinctive and enthralling visuals.
04.Incorporate emotions or moods: Specify the emotional ambiance or feeling you aim for the image to convey. Be it awe, serenity, or thrill, establishing the right atmosphere can amplify the resonance of the generated visual.
05.Combine elements: Don't hesitate to merge various elements or ideas in your prompts to inspire creative and surprising visuals. For example, consider suggesting "a futuristic metropolis adorned with hovering gardens and robotic entertainers.
06.Iteration and refinement: If the initial result doesn't match your expectations, adjust and fine-tune your prompts. Play with various phrases or modify the language to get closer to your envisioned outcome.
